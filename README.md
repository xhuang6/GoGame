# GoGame
A computer game based on java, designed for beginners to get familiar with and play the game of Go; realized all the rules of Go with basic artificial intelligence; Adopted Monte-Carlo method and min-max method

#### /GoGame
The integral code for the Go game.
For the personal computer, the AI need more than ten minutes to calculat its next set.

#### /without MiniMax
The code for testing.
The AI do not have MiniMax algorithm. It only need 3 secounds to calculat its next set. But the sets nearly random. 

#### Abstract
Go is one of the most famous board game in the world. With a history of more than 4000 years, Go is a decent board game originated in ancient China. Although Go game has a long history, computer Go has not yet been developed more than 100 years. The AI of computer Go game has fast developed in recent years but not enough. The best Go programmes are ranked only as 2 â€“ 5 dan today. The AI of computer Go beat the best Go player has long way to go.
The aim of this project is made a 9x9 computer Go game which has an AI that can satisfy most of the beginners of Go game. The difficulties of this project are to achieve the rules of Go game on board and build up an artificial intelligence (AI).
The AI in this project is used the mini-max search way that based on the Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo method is the most basic and famous algorithm for the Computer Go game. This method is also useful in the 9x9 size board. It can not solve all the problems of the computer Go game but provide enough data to analyse and help people to build up a new AI algorithm.
